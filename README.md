# Tree Based Federated Learning
Basic Cross-Silo Horizontal Federated Learning PoC using Socket Programming with Decision Tree-based Model Training

# About
Federated Learning (FL) is a groundbreaking approach to collaborative machine learning that prioritizes data privacy by enabling multiple parties to train models without directly sharing raw data. This project focuses on a specific FL paradigm known as Cross-Silo Horizontal Federated Learning.

In this proof of concept, we utilize Walmart Weekly Sales data to simulate an environment with multiple clients and a server, all hosted locally. Each client represents a separate data silo, and their contributions are aggregated on a central server.

Our implementation employs Socket Programming, a fundamental communication mechanism, to facilitate interaction between distributed clients and the server.
